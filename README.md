# CommProjectComparisons

Hi, this github site is home for Rust vs C++ vs C# code comparisons.  Currently the contributors are <a href="https://JimFawcett.gitub.io">**Jim Fawcett**</a> and <a href="https://mwcorley79.github.io/MikeCorley/">**Mike Corley**</a>.
- The site is just starting, so only one half of one comparison is here.
- More to come soon.
